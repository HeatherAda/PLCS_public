# IPSN 2020: Selective Sampling for Sensor Type Classification in Buildings

This repository contains a reference implementation of our proposed selective sampling method metadata mapping method published in IPSN 2020.

# Setup
Python 2.7

# Data description
The weak oracles are generated based on transferred classifiers trained on other buildings, the raw sensor data and preprocessing code are in /data and /preprocess respectively.

# Running the program
To run the program:
```sh
$ python SS.py 
```
